This folder contains various Jupyter Notebooks with hands-on demonstrations and tutorials for working with the Supernova SDK, including:

- **GPIO-API**: Tutorial on how to use Supernova API to control the 6x GPIOs as digital inputs/outputs.
- **I2C-Protocol-API:** Tutorial on how to use Supernova API to perform I2C protocol transactions.
- **I3C-Protocol-API:** Tutorial on how to use Supernova API to perform I3C protocol transactions in both I3C Controller and I3C Target mode.
    - **I3C-Protocol-Controller-API:** Tutorial on how to use Supernova API to perform I3C protocol transactions and handle In-Band Interrupts in I3C Controller mode.
    - **PIC18QF16Q20-I3C-to-SPI-I2C-translator:** Tutorial on the PIC18QF16Q20 protocol translator example with Supernova API to control the Supernova as the I3C Controller. This tutorial shows how the Supernova SDK handles Hot-Join and In-Band Interrupts.
