# Demo Supernova with PIC18F16Q20 board

This folder contains a demonstration project for interfacing with the PIC18F16Q20 board using the Supernova host adapter connected to the I3C High Voltage bus. The objective of this project is to utilize a modification of the [PIC18QF16Q20 as a protocol translator](https://mplab-discover.microchip.com/com.microchip.mcu8.mplabx.project.pic18f16q20-i3c-multi-protocol-translator-mplab-mcc) image for the PIC18F16Q20, issuing custom I3C commands to execute the following transactions:

- I2C write
