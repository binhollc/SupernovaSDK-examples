# SupernovaSDK-examples

Welcome to the SupernovaSDK examples repository! This public repository provides a collection of examples intended to show the users how the API of the [Supernova SDK](https://pypi.org/project/BinhoSupernova/) works.  

### Jupyter Notebooks

The [notebooks](./notebooks/) folder hosts different Jupyter notebooks sorted in sub folders by protocol or interface. [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are an interactive user interface that allows user to run code in cells. Maybe you do not know the name Jupyter Notebooks but you may have used [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) instead, which is based on Jupyter Notebooks. Finally, there is also a [Visual Studio Code extension for Jupyter Notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

### Python scripts

The [scripts](./scripts/) folder is intended to host examples using simple python scripts and modules. However, this folder has not received maintenance in the last few months and the contents might be outdated. You will find and examples of how to sequence operations with the Supernova SDK and the [TransferController](https://pypi.org/project/transfer-controller/).
